# Tic-tac-toe game (Angular + NodeJS)

This is a tic-tac-toe game made with Angular, RxJS, NodeJS and websockets. Used typescript on the backend as well. I did not use Express nor Socket.io so we can dive more deeply into Node.

# Features
- lobby
- play against another user
- play against AI
- spectators

Several test cases for critical logic are also implemented with Mocha & Chai.

# Installation
- ```npm install``` in both client and server folders

# Running
- ```npm run dev``` in backend folder
- ```ng serve --open``` in client folder (if no angular CLI then ```npm install -g @angular/cli```)
